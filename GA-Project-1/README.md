# GA-Project1

For my project, I decided to build The Office TV show trivia game. My API of choice was the Giphy API.

I opted for a simple/minimal design and mainly styled using CSS. To make things easier, I built the logo in Photoshop. The complex UI I built was a modal message that appeared after every multiple choice answer was clicked to review whether or not the choice picked was correct or incorrect. There is also a modal message at the very end to reveal the game has ended, as well as the number of correct answers the user picked.

The API I used did not have any trivia questions or answers related to The Office so I had to program the questions, answers, and multiple choice options into three separate arrays.

When the user clicks on the Start button, the first trivia question, multiple choice options for the question, and a "Next Question" and "Show Answer" button options are initialized and displayed on the screen.  

The user can then answer the question by clicking on one of the multiple choice options
